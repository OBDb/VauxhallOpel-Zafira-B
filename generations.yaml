    description: "The Vauxhall/Opel Zafira B represented the second generation of the popular European compact MPV (Multi-Purpose Vehicle), building upon the success of its predecessor with enhanced practicality, technology, and refinement. Built on General Motors' Delta platform shared with the contemporary Astra H, the Zafira B featured more modern, aerodynamic styling while maintaining the boxy, high-roof silhouette required for maximum interior space. The defining feature remained the innovative Flex7 seating system allowing for various configurations from seven-seat people carrier to two-seat cargo hauler, with the third row of seats that could fold flat into the floor—a feature that continued to distinguish the Zafira from many competitors. Engine options varied by market and model year but typically included 1.6, 1.8, and 2.0-liter petrol units and 1.9-liter diesel engines, with power outputs ranging from approximately 105 to 200 horsepower in the performance-oriented OPC/VXR variants. Transmission choices included five and six-speed manual and four and six-speed automatic options. The interior featured a driver-oriented cockpit with a notably high-mounted gear lever, improved materials compared to the first generation, and enhanced technology including an available navigation system and panoramic glass roof. A significant innovation was the optional FlexFix integrated bicycle carrier that could slide out from the rear bumper—a unique feature in the segment. Safety features expanded to include up to six airbags, stability control, and active head restraints. A substantial facelift in 2008 brought updated styling with elements from Opel's then-new design language, interior refinements, and additional equipment options. The Zafira B successfully continued the model's formula of combining compact exterior dimensions with maximum interior versatility, achieving strong sales particularly in European markets where MPVs remained popular family vehicles before the subsequent shift toward crossover SUVs."
